more-> 
  The more command allows you to view the content of a file one screen at a time. Itâ€™s useful for reading long files without having to open them in an editor.

  Syntax :-
    more <file-name>

less->
  The less command is more advanced than more. It also allows you to view the content of a file, but it provides more functionality and is generally more efficient.

  Syntax :-
    less <file-name>

Both more and less commands used to view long files contents. But less is more advanced. We can search any pattern in less command by '/<pattern>'.
By pressing 'q', quit the file. 
By pressing 'b', go back to one page.
By pressing 'SPACE', go to next page.
By pressing 'ENTER', go to new line.
